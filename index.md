## Pi Algorithm
### Pi Algorithm Finished

Main Class Declare Variables - Maybe needed to compare outcome to the answer we want?... ! Pi Start which will be called strtp @ infinite loop variable for n int + 2(odds) # String for length limited in this case "" $ Another string but name for the same as the last one % Here will be the loop ^ If n+2 of strp/ by n+2 @ (might end up using % because of odds though) # same case as on top but declare a - everyother on is + then - @# make the strtp + @ here is n+2 # use 2nd string name to = to limt $% Declare the output or comparison as the first ? varible ! - [PiAlgorithmFinished](https://github.com/Elun4705/IB-Programming---Portifolio/tree/gh-pages/Year%201/PiAlgorithmFinished)

The following code is an unfinished Tester for recursion methods - [Recursion](PiAlgorithmFinished)

### Tanker

Input Display "average ounces a year" Annual consumed fluids (oz) = (average ounces a day * 365) Display "Life expectancy" Fluids consumed in life (oz)= (Annual consumed fluids (oz) * Longevity of life) Ounces to gallons = (Fluids consumed in life(oz)/128) Tanks filled = (gallons/11,000) Output Tanks filled - [Tanker](https://github.com/Elun4705/IB-Programming---Portifolio/tree/gh-pages/Year%201/Tanker)

### Big Java

Any file containing big java contains activivies used to learn the functionality in each in addition to a project related to the topic, ex. Tic-Tac-Toe
