Evaluation Tips (from www.stocktrader.com/2007/09/12/60-stock-tips-for-investment-success/):

Always cut your losses at 8% below your purchase price

Concentrate on a few, high-quality stocks. There’s no need to own twenty or more stocks.

Don’t buy a stock under $15 a share.

The optimal buying point of any stock is the “pivot point”.

Replace the old adage, “buy low and sell high” with “buy high and sell a lot higher.”

You want to buy a stock at its pivot point. Don’t chase a stock up more than 5% past its pivot.

If you have less than $5,000 to invest, only own one or two stocks. If you have $10,000-two or three stocks; $25,000-three or four stocks; $50,000-four or five stocks; and, $100,000 or more-own no more than six stocks.

If you already own the maximum number of stocks buy want to add a new stock to your portfolio, force yourself to sell the least profitable stock to get money for the new name.
