WHAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE STOCKS:
1: VALUE PER SHARE WHEN BOUGHT
2: CURRENT VALUE PER SHARE
3: INDEX OF STOCK
4: CURRENT %D (SSTO)
5: CURRENT %K (SSTO)
//When %K is above %D it is a good time to buy
//When %K is below %D it is a good time to sell
//When %K is above %D but both are less than twenty it is the best time to buy
//When %K is below %D but both are greater than eighty it is the best time to sell
