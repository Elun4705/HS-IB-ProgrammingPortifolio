As it stands the class (most likely) cannot be utilized to send emails on the school network because of IBOSS'S restrictions.
The SMTP server being used is provided by Google (GMAIL).
Google also offers an API for GMail that appears to be a pain to setup but once it is installed works well.
In order to run the class you will need to have Javax.mail imported as an API
Username and password for the google account associated with the stock application is available in the source code "ad.java" in this directory
We should consider using a mobile hotspot of sorts to circumvent the limitations of IBOSS so that the emails can be sent out successfully.
SMS would be another viable option, however a sim card would need to be provided and this method would likely cost more money than other methods.  SMS could also be utilized through email though.
Email through GMAIL would be free as long as we don't exceed around 99 emails a day. This shouldn't be a problem because the application should only send out one Email at the end of the day. 
Further documentation on the limits of the email's using the SMTP server is available here: https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en
