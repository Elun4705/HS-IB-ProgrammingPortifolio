# Musical Role Playing Game

Project for IB Comp Sci IA 2021:
Musical Adventure.  This program will allow the player to play a mini RPG, but at the beats of the music damage changes, increasing it depending on the user timed input

<br /> 
Currently, I will be using an enum for the different stages of the player and the enemy bats.

The program takes in the number the movements of the character and displays them in a 2D format. To make it easier on the player, bat only do minimal damage and are given 6 possible collision with the bats. Moreover the moment the damage increase beat occurs, a UI element will flash to give the player an understanding of when the player is attack.

This will be displayed using Godot Game Engine. All actions will be taken and executed to the programs best efficiency.
